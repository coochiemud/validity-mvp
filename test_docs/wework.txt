WeWork Investment Memo

Thesis: WeWork is a technology company, not a real estate company, and should be valued accordingly.

Market: The coworking market is growing at 15% annually. WeWork has a unique community-driven platform that creates network effects. As more members join, the value to each member increases.

Technology: WeWork's proprietary space management software and member app differentiate it from traditional real estate. The company is building a platform for the future of work.

Traction: Rapid growth in locations (300+ globally) and membership (500K+ members) demonstrates product-market fit.

Valuation: Technology companies trade at 10-15x revenue. WeWork should command a premium valuation given its network effects and proprietary platform.

Therefore, a $47B valuation is justified.
